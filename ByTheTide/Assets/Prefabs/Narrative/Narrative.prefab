  - "I hope you aren\u2019t expecting this to be easy. You\u2019ve made it past so
    much. We have to up the stakes. Things will move, and the rain will be persistent.
    But I know if you\u2019ve made it here, you can make it through this level. "
  - "See, I told you that you would be just fine. And I told you that you didn\u2019t
    need to worry about the fire hydrant last level. If you make it to the end, I
    may give you a better explanation. "
  - "Well I guess I did promise. The fire hydrant is because we couldn\u2019t think
    of anything cooler. It was going to be a toilet. And then we felt that was ridiculous.
    So it became a fire hydrant.  Who knows, it may be magical fish soon. "
